# ChefsNotes

ChefsNotes is a new way to store your favourite recipes with a focus on helping you perfect your recipes.

Anyone who likes cooking or baking and wants to store and track their favourite recipes will love ChefsNotes. Chefs of all skill levels can utilize this app to not only keep their recipes organized, but perfect them as their abilities grow. Whether you’re looking for a safer and easier way to store your family recipes, a way to categorize and organize your recipes, a way to modify and rate your recipes, or an easy way to group recipes by meal, ChefsNotes has something for every Chef!

ChefsNotes provides a compact way to store your recipes and allows you to modify them as your abilities grow. With the ability to add notes, photos, directions, ratings, and categorizations to any recipes, you can customize your recipe book exactly how you like it. ChefsNotes makes it easy to find your recipes by name, genre, culture, or any categorizations you would like! It can also find recipes by ingredients to help you make the most of the ingredients you have. The flexibility of a physical book meets the functionality of an application in ChefsNotes.

Recipes can be combined into a meal with set serving sizes and a combined ingredient list for convenience. Similar to recipes, Chefs can add and display photos, notes, and categorizations in meals. From the meal page, you can see the overview, including any photos and notes, the full ingredient list, and the included recipes. Chefs can scale and save recipe serving sizes up or down for a specific meal, so you always know how much to make. The unique meal feature of ChefsNotes makes the often-frustrating aspects of planning a complex meal much simpler!

Unlike other recipe applications, ChefsNotes is focused on making you a better Cook! We know that every time you cook a recipe, even one you make regularly, you think of something that could possibly make it better. We want to harness that by including a section for notes where you can write down your small changes, big ideas, and possible substitutions. You can modify the recipe when you’ve made it better, or you can duplicate it to add those changes while preserving your original recipe! Let your recipes grow with you with ChefsNotes.

ChefsNotes will be considered successful if Play Store user ratings are above 3.5/5 by 6 months, and user retention is above 50% in the first 6 months. To be successful, the project will also need a total of at least 1000 downloads.
