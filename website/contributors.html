                    I chose to focus on the UI elements of this project to expose myself to a new skill set. I had never worked on anything related to UIs before and this experience provided me with the opportunity for growth and learning. I prioritized learning to design and build with a focus on the user experience, and how to balance the functionality with the UI. Other skills I have built throughout this project include how to use GitLab properly, how to work with multiple developers within a project, how to collaborate with others in both the designing and coding stages, how to work with code written by others and write code for use by others, and most importantly I have gained a new love for developing applications and frontend development.

                    Working on integrating the database into the project provided me with a new beginning toolset on subsystem integration. The ability to integrate other developersâ€™ packages and tools into a software is incredibly important in the field and I am thrilled to have had an opportunity to begin discovering what it takes to achieve that skillset. I took this course as an elective to gain skills and techniques associated with software design, and have been duly rewarded with such knowledge. Having the opportunity to employ design patterns, good programming practices, and the agile methodology in a developer team has been an enriching experience. I see more than just code now; I see patterns, structure, and design intent.

                    Working on providing communication to the UI elements and passing that data down to the database interface has allowed me to experience working with implementations of features that I did not create. Through this process I have gained strong skills in debugging code written by others, and learning how it was implemented to allow myself to work with it successfuly. Additionally, I was able to learn how to manage time and workload in small team projects with an agile workflow environment.

                    This project provided me with the opportunity to learn how to work with the UI tools provided by Android Studio, as well as the Espresso test API. Additionally, working as part of a team meant working with custom code which I was not responsible for writing, as well as writing code which had to be legible and well documented for other peoples use. This experience thus improved my ability to communicate the purpose of code, and to interpret and debug code written by other people.

                    Working in a small, agile group of developers allowed me to develop skills in agile project planning and management using software such as Miro and Gitlab, and also valuable experience in writing modular code in such a way that it can painlessly be utilized by other developers.
